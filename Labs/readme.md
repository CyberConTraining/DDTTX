# Lab Setup

## Infrastructure
Your infrastructure can really be hosted anywhere.
- Locally via vmware, virtualbox, etc
- In the cloud via Azure, GCP, AWS
- Prod? (j/k)

### 1. Windows Domain Controller

### 2. Windows Endpoint
### 3. Kali Linux
### 4. Optional - Whatever you need for SIEM?
In my case you will see in the demos that I'm using a Blumira sensor. This is an Ubuntu box with a docker container that has a [Blumira](https://www.blumira.com) sensor installed on it. Because this isn't a SIEM training, it's difficult to go through a full lab setup of something like ELK or Splunk.
